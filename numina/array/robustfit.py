"""Robust fits"""

import numpy


def fit_theil_sen(x, y):
    """Compute a robust linear fit using the Theil-Sen method.

    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil%E2%80%93Sen_estimator for details.
    This function "pairs up sample points by the rank of their x-coordinates
    (the point with the smallest coordinate being paired with the first point
    above the median coordinate, etc.) and computes the median of the slopes of
    the lines determined by these pairs of points".

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 1d numpy array, float
        X coordinate array.
    y : 1d or 2d numpy array, float
        Y coordinate array. If the array is two dimensional, each column of
        the array is independently fitted sharing the same x-coordinates. In
        this last case, the returned intercepts and slopes are also 1d numpy
        arrays.

    Returns
    -------
    intercept : float or 1d numpy array
        Intercept(s) of the linear fit(s).
    slope : float or 1d numpy array
        Slope(s) of the linear fit(s).
